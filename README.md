# JS-WebCrawler 🕷️

A simple, yet powerful command line web crawler built with JavaScript. This project aims to crawl through a specified website, navigate its pages, and generate a comprehensive report of its structure and content.

## Main Features 🌟

- Single website crawling: Provide a base URL to start the crawl.
- Comprehensive report generation: Summarizes the structure and content of the website.
- Command line interface: Easy to use and integrate into scripts or other projects.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KevinZ7/js-webcrawler.git
cd js-webcrawler
```

Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Usage

To start crawling a website, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start <website_url>
```

Replace <website_url> with the actual URL of the website you want to crawl.

Note: The crawler expects exactly one website argument. If no websites are provided or too many arguments are given, it will terminate with an error message.
